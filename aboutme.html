		Hi! Welcome to my photography site! Below is just a little about me. 
	</p1>

	<p2 id="paragraph2">
		I'm from the small town of Greenwood, AR with a population of 9,300 people. Currently a junior at Claremont McKenna College in Southern California but I am studying abroad in Wellington, New Zealand from June 28th to November 13th. Currently declared as a psychology major, computer science minor but things may change as they have often before. I have no idea what I am going to do with my life after I recieve a degree so hopefully I will have an apiphany about that sometime soon. 
	</p2>

	<p3 id="paragraph3">
		I built this site using HTML and CSS, which I completely taught myself. And I am currently working on teaching myself JavaScript so that I can transition to that for more functionality because HTML and CSS is very limited. 
	</p3>

	<p4 id="paragraph4">
		I hope you enjoy my site and be sure to check out my instagram (@austingosch) for more of my photos!
